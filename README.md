# Q2

**Description:** This is an ongoing hardware, software, and design project built for Alpine Coffee Company. If you drink coffee, it's likely that you've used a K-cup pod before. These coffee pods require lots of infrastructure, including the ability to roast, package, and transport the coffee and the pods. Nonetheless, there is often little quality control functionality built in. Accordingly, this device was built to automate the process of quality control, and continues to be maintained.

**Specs:** The 3D models were all created in AutoCAD and the code is written in Java with additional GUI capability written in Java. The hardware includes a Raspberry Pi 3 B+, laser diodes, servo motors, photoresistors, and a camera component.
